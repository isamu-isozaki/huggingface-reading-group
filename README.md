# Hugginface Reading Group
Welcome to the Huggingface Reading Group! The goal of this group is to have a weekly presentation on research papers/groups of papers. The goal of this repository is to compile all the past presentation write-ups and recordings.

## Brief History
This group was started by Huggingface community member James Kelly on 09/26/2023. In the beginning, we "presented" via a summary of papers in discord threads but we started 1/12/2024 to do presentations in discord calls thanks to Phil Butler. The presentations, in general, are targetted for the general audience on the subject of Generative Models but no research papers are off limits.
